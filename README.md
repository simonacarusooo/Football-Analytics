# Football-Analytics

The Lab had the aim to introduce students to football analytics, with the goal to
understand the main sources and types of data, the metrics and algorithms most used, as well as what are the main future
challenges. The Lab included a series of lectures and a group activity where
students were asked to build a small algorithm by participating in an internal hackathon on current match data. 

Our activity consisted of creating models with the goal of predicting the success of dribbles made in the current season (2023-2024) with the Bundesliga and Premier League as reference leagues.

Feature engineering proved essential in obtaining usable starting data for model creation. The code present in the repositories contains all the comments on the steps followed to obtain the final classification. An accompanying presentation has been created to better describe the activities carried out.

Enjoy!!!!
